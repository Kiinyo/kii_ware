# Introduction
Welcome to kii_ware()! At its heart, this is a simple toy open-source hardware emulator. Inspired by games like Shenzhen I/O and the experience of breadboarding contraptions, the goal of kii_ware() is to create a similar experience without the entry cost of traditional hardware tinkering and a simple core that makes designing and getting new parts as simple a quick copy and paste!
# How it works
Every bit of kiiware is simply a collection of "components" that are connected via a "board". Just like their real life counterpart, a component knows nothing about the state of the system as a whole and only knows the state of its pins. A board, similar to a breadboard, is the way in which you connect components together!
